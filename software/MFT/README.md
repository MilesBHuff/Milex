Download the latest version of MFT for your system [here](https://network.nvidia.com/products/adapter-software/firmware-tools).
Extract the files.
If you have an old version of MFT installed, run `old-mft-uninstall.sh`.
Run `install.sh`.
That's it!

I wish there were some way to automatically download and install new updates. Alas that proprietary software is so annoying.
